# Advent of Code 2022
This is my repository of AOC solutions done in Elixir

My original solutions are done in livebook (which isn't very shareable since it's locally hosted), so I move them to a different file after and upload them here!
 
The solutions are all in .exs script files (if you want to run them it's explained in the inner README). And for the current year is displayed in the table below. which is formated with the day and how long the solutions took me according to the aoc personal stats. These aren't the most accurate to the amount of time I spent on the problem, since I don't always start at 9:00 but it's a relatively interesting indicator for how long the solutions take.

## Table of times and solutions for 2022
