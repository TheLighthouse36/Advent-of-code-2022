# Advent of Code 2022
This is my repository of AOC solutions done in Elixir

My original solutions are done in livebook (which isn't very shareable since it's locally hosted), so I move them to a different file after and upload them here!
 
This is in a mix project so that I can keep organized and reuse code but that does make it hard to parse what's happening. So to help with that the table has links to the files that have the relavent code. The folder structure is shown on the next readme.

## Table of times and solutions
| Day | Part 1 | Part 2 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 1 | ~9:30 | ~9:35 |
